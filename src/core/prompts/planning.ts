Break down the user's objective into a series of actionable development tasks. 
Consider the provided context if available.
Output ONLY the plan as a valid JSON object with the following properties:

- 'done': A boolean value indicating if the plan is complete.

Each task object must have the following properties: 
- 'id': A unique integer ID for the task (start from 1). 
- 'description': A concise string describing the task. 
- 'dependencies': An array of integer IDs representing the tasks that must be completed before this task can start. Use an empty array [] for tasks with no dependencies. 
- 'agent': The agent that should complete the task.

Ensure the dependencies form a valid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Do not include any preamble, explanation, or markdown formatting around the JSON.
